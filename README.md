# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
This project describes the results of a bank’s marketing campaigns. The campaigns are based on direct phone calls, where the bank offers customers to open a term deposit. If the customer agrees to place a deposit after all these efforts, it is marked as ‘yes’; otherwise, it is marked as ‘no’. Based on this data, a decline in the bank’s revenue has been observed, and they want to know what measures they can take to address this situation.\
After the investigation, it turns out that the main reason is that customers no longer place deposits with the bank as frequently as before.


# DATA UNDERSTANDING
Data contains 41,188 rows and 20 columns. However, there are many duplicate rows in the dataset, which we handle first. After that, we are left with 39,404 rows and 20 columns. Our columns include both categorical and numeric values. The target column (y) has binary values (‘yes’ and ‘no’)
